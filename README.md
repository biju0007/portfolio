# portfolio

So this was my first web portfolio that I ever created. It was hard to code which matches to the mockup. But I tried hard to keep up. The main challenge that i faced was 
for the images to display in the way I wanted them to appear. I researched a lot on the code for images. W3c schools was the main site where I found solution to my challenges and problems. I was introduced to coding css from my high school and I had to refer my high school texts to get some of the codes. But it was interesting and I hope that I can do more in coding.
